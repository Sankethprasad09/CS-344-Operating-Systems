README.txtTitle: Files and Directories Author: Sanketh Karuturi Language: CDescription:This C program processes movie data from a CSV file, and writes movie titles to separate text files based on their year of release. The program allows the user to choose a file to process (either the largest, smallest, or a specified file), creates a directory with a random number suffix, reads and processes the chosen file, and writes movie titles to separate files based on the year of release.Usage:1. Compile the C program using a suitable compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang). Example: gcc -o movies movies_by_year.c2. Run the compiled executable. Example: ./movies3. Follow the on-screen prompts to select a file to process and execute the desired operations.Program Structure:The program consists of the following functions:* createDirectory: Creates a directory with the given name and sets appropriate permissions.* processFile: Reads and processes the specified file, writing movie titles to separate year-based files.* selectFileToProcess: Prompts the user to choose a file for processing and calls the processFile function accordingly.* main: Provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the program.Dependencies:The program depends on the following standard C library headers:* stdio.h* stdlib.h* dirent.h* string.h* sys/stat.h

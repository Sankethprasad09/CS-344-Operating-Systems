==============================Assignment 4: Multi-threaded Producer Consumer Counter==============================Program Description:--------------------This program uses two threads (Producer and Consumer) to increment a shared variable "myCount" from 0 to 10. The Producer increments "myCount" when its value is even, and the Consumer increments it when it's odd. The shared variable is protected by a mutex "myMutex". The program makes use of two condition variables "myCond1" and "myCond2" to alternate the operations of the Producer and Consumer threads.Prerequisites:--------------- This program is written in C and hence requires GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) to compile it.Compilation Instructions:------------------------1. Navigate to the directory containing the source code file (myCounter.c) using the 'cd' command in the terminal.2. Compile the source code using GCC with the following command:   $ gcc -o myCounter myCounter.c -lpthreadRunning the Program:-------------------1. After the successful compilation of the source code, an executable named "myCounter" will be created in the same directory.2. Run the program by entering the following command in the terminal:   $ ./myCounterProgram Output:--------------The program will print messages to the standard output (the terminal), displaying the state of the program as per the instructions and requirements mentioned in the assignment.Author:-------Sanketh Karuturi, karutusa@oregonstate.edu06/04/2023

Introduction:This README file contains instructions on how to compile the provided code (movies.c) using the GCC compiler. The code is a C program that processes a CSV file containing movie data and provides functionality to display movies based on user-specified criteria.Dependencies:To compile and run the program, you need to have the GCC compiler installed on your system.Compilation:To compile the code, open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the movies.c file, and then run the following command:Copy code      gcc -o movies movies.c This command will compile the movies.c file and create an executable file called 'movies' Usage:To run the compiled program, you need to provide the path to a CSV file containing movie data as a command-line argument. ./movies <path_to_csv_file> Replace '<path_to_csv_file>' with the path to the CSV file containing the movie data.Example:./movies movies_sample.csv After running the program, you will be presented with a menu that allows you to perform the following actions:1. Show movies released in a specified year.2. Show the highest-rated movie for each year.3. Show movies and their year of release for a specific language.4. Exit.Enter the corresponding number to choose an action. Follow the prompts to provide additional information when necessary.Note: The program is case-sensitive when searching for movie languages.
